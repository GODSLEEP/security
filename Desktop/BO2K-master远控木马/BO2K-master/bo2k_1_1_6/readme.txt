*************************************************************************************************
---< 1.1.5 ( 18 Jan 07 ) >---

The first thing that must be stated is that backward compatibility has been compromised to an extent. For the most part you can still communicate between older servers and the new client or older clients and the new server etc. but behavior will be erratic when attempting some commands. It is highly recommended that you replace all older servers and their plugins with all the latest from this package.

- New Server ver 1.1.5

a. Rewritten to accommodate rootkit for injected servers using "browser only" option


- New Client (ver 1.2.0.3)

a. Deletion of listener sockets fixed to prevent crash
b. Insert and Delete keys now work for listener sockets
c. Client "hang" on command query during some initial connects fixed
d. Reverse logic rewritten to allow for more than one server from same remote address
e. Client crash when reverse botool connect requested and botool plugin not loaded fixed


- New Server Configuration Utility (ver 1.2.0.5)

a. ENTER and ESC keys now trapped to prevent the tab page from blanking.


- New cli_botool.dll  (ver 1.5.0.6)

a. Disconnect menu item on botool registry client fixed
b. Fatal hang when attempting to view REG_MULTI_SZ values fixed
c. Crash protection when botool registry client can't read a value/key
d. Remote process spawn fixed so that the correct message shows if unsuccessful


- New srv_rootkit.dll (ver 1.1)

a. Rootkit now works correctly for all settings including the "browser only" injection option


- New srv_reverser.dll (ver 1.4)

a. Changes to code to improve reverse connections.
b. Changes to how communications sent to client for reverse botool connections.


--------Known issues--------
The reverse connect for botool can get out of sync sometimes...if it happens close down client and restart.
Insidious mode is flakey...don't use it
Remote to remote file transfer is broken for now......
Repeated attempts for reverse registry connect can cause client to not recognize the botool plugin

************************************************************************************

1.1.4 (15/12/06)

- New Server (ver 1.1.4)

a. Stealth now works on all windows systems including Windows XP SP 1 & 2 (injection)
b. Process hop now works on NT/XP systems allowing you to hop from one app to another turning bo2k effectively into the "Ghost in the machine"
c. New option "Listen Socket" allows you to turn on or off bo2k's listening socket for traditional connections...this is useful for when the reverse plugin is installed and you don't want bo2k detected as a listening server.
d. New option "Browser Only" allows you to keep bo2k sitting inert in the background until the default browser starts at which time bo2k will inject itself into the browser and the reverse plugin will attempt outbound connections...effective against firewalls.
e. Delete server changed for injected servers.


- New Client (ver 1.2)

a. Client redesigned to place listening sockets on a bottom panel and normal connections on the top panel (Thanks to James Keane for the design)
b. Code re-written to allow for unlimited number of listening sockets
c. The "Save workspace" option now allows for listening sockets to be saved in either active or inactive state.
d. Control buttons added for listening socket control, open/close, delete, edit.
e. Code rewritten to allow for easier reverse botool connection, instead of having to set up a new listen port for every botool connection, botool will now use the listen port used for server connection.
f. Splash screen and credits changed.


- New Server Configuration Utility (ver 1.2.0.3)

a. Complete re-design using a tabbed interface allowing for easier viewing of loaded plugins and variable settings.
b. New XP look
c. Allows for drag and drop for loading plugins.
d. New config dump option for easier debugging help.


- New srv_regfile.dll (ver 1.3)

a. Now allows for proper display of Large files and and allows for transfers of files larger than 100 Mb.
b. Allows for resumable uploads and downloads (Must be used with latest botool [ver 1.5.0.2])


- New srv_control.dll (ver 1.2)

- New Server 

a. "delete original file" re-enabled
b. "eradicate server" now actually removes the server from the remote machine as well as all 	registry entries
c. Stealth is re-enabled as part of the server...save me the rhetoric...there are legitimate 		reasons for stealth in a server. It will effectively hide bo2k from any win9x process 	list but unfortunatly it can't hide in NT type systems.
d. Latest Plugins from the Novice page included

- New Client 
a. Allows option to get rid of disconnect request when closing dialog box
b. Allows "right click" on server list window for connecting plugins
c. Includes a new "plugins" button which allows for quick connects with all details filled in    	http://bo2k.sourceforge.net/novice/Client.htm
d. Latest Plugins from the Novice page included


************************************************************************************
